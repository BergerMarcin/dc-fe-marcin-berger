# Requirements
 - The goal of the task is to create a SPA that will allow its users to browse characters of Rick & Morty series and create a list of favorite characters.
 - Characters should be retrieved from Rick & Morty GraphQL API.
 - The application should be created based on the provided Figma wireframe.
 - Use Vue as the framework and support it with TypeScript.
 - Favorite characters should be stored locally on the client side.
 - Upload your task to a private repo in GitHub, name the project “dc-fe-imie-nazwisko” (e.g. “dc-fe-jan-kowalski”) and share your repo with j.jakubowski@digitalcolliers.com and s.nowak@digitalcolliers.com.
 - Deploy your app on Netlify using the free “Starter” plan (https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) and share the link to the app in README.md in your repository.
 - You have a week (5 business days) to complete the task.

# Guidelines
 - Remember to design it with scalability in mind. Think of it as an MVP of an application that might be substantially extended in the future.
 - Think of handling edge cases and unexpected scenarios that are not visible at first glance on the Figma wireframe. We’re going to do a thorough QA of your app.
 - We really pay attention to the detail. Pixel perfect approach is a must.
 - Remember about mobile devices and users with retina screens.
 - Make sure you read all the requirements twice. We’re going to check that as well.
 - We left some space for interpretation and creativity. If you have a question, try to figure it out on your own.
   
# How to earn additional scores
 - Prove that you’re up to date with the latest technology. For example, using the latest ECMAScript standard or Vue 3 (or at least some of its elements like Composition API) would be a huge plus.
