# Project issues
## TailwindCSS - PostCSS 8 issues with Vue
It was not so easy to install and start running TailwindCSS. There is issue with PostCSS 8 and Vue.

I solved it acc. https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build
(but I found it after 2h because Vue CLI recommends website which unfortunately does not solve the issue: https://github.com/postcss/postcss/wiki/PostCSS-8-for-end-users;
Vue should add link to Tailwind website url as stated above)
