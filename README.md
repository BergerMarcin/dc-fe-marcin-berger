- GraphQL
- Vuex

Node.js v.12.22.1 LTS

### Changed dependencies to remove high vulnerabilities @ `package-lock.json`
All high vulnerabilities are related to `normalize-url` or `css-what` package. These issues are not solved yet by Vue (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/6523)
It could be manually removed by manual update of package dependencies @ `package-lock.json` (but it is risky if packages would work) by set fixed packages:
```
css-what
"version": "5.0.1",
"resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/css-what/-/css-what-5.0.1.tgz",
"integrity": "sha512-FYDTSHb/7KXsWICVsxdmiExPjCfRC4qRFBdVwv7Ax9hMnvMmEjP9RfxTEZ3qPZGmADDn2vAKSo9UcN1jKVYscg=="

# Project issues
## TailwindCSS - PostCSS 8 issues with Vue
It was not so easy to install and start running TailwindCSS. There is issue with PostCSS 8 and Vue.

I solved it acc. https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build
(but I found it after 2h because Vue CLI recommends website which unfortunately does not solve the issue: https://github.com/postcss/postcss/wiki/PostCSS-8-for-end-users;
Vue should add link to Tailwind website url as stated above)
